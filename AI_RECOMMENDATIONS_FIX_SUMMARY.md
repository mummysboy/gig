# AI Recommendations Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The AI service was not generating correct recommendations from sample data due to **category mismatches** between:
- What the AI service was recommending (e.g., "Tutoring", "Cleaning", "Coaching")
- What was available in the sample data (e.g., "Tutor", "Cleaner", "Coach")

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Category Name Mismatches**: AI service used different category names than sample data
2. **Insufficient Sample Data**: Missing providers for many AI-recommended categories
3. **Limited Service Definitions**: Service.sampleServices() didn't support all categories
4. **Poor Fallback Logic**: When no exact matches found, generic providers were suggested

## Files Modified

### 1. AIService.swift
**Changes Made**:
- Updated system prompt to use **exact category names** that match sample data
- Improved mock analysis with more comprehensive keyword matching
- Added support for: Plumber, Electrician, Personal Trainer, Photographer, Carpenter, Painter, Landscaper
